Password Strength Checker - Python
A simple and interactive Python program that checks whether a password meets common security requirements and guides the user to create a strong password.

About the Project
This project validates user-entered passwords based on standard security rules and provides clear feedback about what is missing.  
The program keeps prompting the user until a valid and strong password is entered.

This helps in understanding:
- String processing
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- Input validation
- Real-world problem solving

Features:
- Password length validation (8–16 characters)
- Checks for:
  - Lowercase letters
  - Uppercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Shows exactly what is missing
- Keeps prompting until a valid password is entered
- User-friendly messages

Concepts Used
- while loop  
- Conditional statements  
- String methods (islower(), isupper(), isdigit())  
- Lists  
- Input / Output
